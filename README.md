## **Project Title**
Second Chance

## **Project Description**
Our project provides food retailers an avenue to sell fruits and vegetables that are not so ‘beautiful’, meaning they may be a little bruised or deformed. Through our web application, customers are able to easily view the availability of ‘ugly’ fruits and vegetables by filtering based on location of the stores and price of the goods. This helps to bridge the gap between customers and retailers, and hence reducing the amount of precious food being thrown into the bins. 
Note that only sellers are able to create an account to upload their listings, consumers are unable to create an account and are only able to view the listings. 
Some of the technologies we used are React JS, HTML, CSS, Python and Sqlite3. In which React JS, HTML and CSS are used for the frontend, and React JS, Python and Sqlite3 are used for the backend development. 

## **How to Use the Project**
### Navbar
Upon clicking the Web application name or logo, users will be brought back to the Mainpage. There is also a login and signup link where sellers can click to be redirected to the Login or Signup page. On the right hand side of the Navbar, there is a profile icon where sellers can click to access their product listing page to view all their listings. 

### Mainpage
Users are able to choose whether to filter the fruits and vegetables listings by location of the stores or price of the fruits and vegetables. Depending on which option they click, they will be brought to the respective ‘Filter by Location’ or ‘Filter by Price’ Produce Listing pages. 

### Produce Listing Page
Users will be able to view all product listings based on the location or price range they entered. In this page, they can see a brief description of the listings in which they can click into to view more details about the products they are interested in.

### Product Information Page
Users can access this page through the produce listing page. In this page, users can view details about the product such as its name, description, price, the name of the store it is sold at and an image of the good.
